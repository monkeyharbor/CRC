About<br>
CR is a fictional device in the form of a physical rock and a chatbot that facilitates communication with the rock. Its aim is to stimulate animistic imagination and disrupt the cultural hegemony that informs our interactions with technology. The project leverages innate human social tendencies to form new narratives with reverence towards natures.  

Set up<br>
Run npm install to load node packages.
 
Development<br>
The project uses the Node.JS web framework Express, Socket.io for data exchange between the bot and users, NeDB to store user-bot communication, and RiveScript scripting language for chatbots. P5.js was used for background visuals/audio.
